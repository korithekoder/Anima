This is the markdown file containing info about functions in the game.

## Groups
A ***group*** is a way to orginize things like items into specific catagories.
Some examples may be `food`, `tools`, `potions`, etc.

This is used to access specifically the `data` and `images` with ease without having to
hardcode the pathways constantly.
